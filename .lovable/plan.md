## Re-run Bot Generation Engine with Winning Archetypes

Today's 21 parlays were all generated by the `mispriced_edge` strategy. The winning archetype profiles (`winning_archetype_3pt_scorer`, `winning_archetype_reb_ast`) are already configured in the engine across all three tiers (Exploration, Validation, Execution) but didn't produce parlays in the last run.

### What will happen

1. **Invoke `bot-generate-daily-parlays`** edge function for today's date -- this will re-run the full generation pipeline including all winning archetype profiles

2. The engine will automatically:
   - Detect the current winning archetypes from the last 14 days of settled data
   - Apply the +15 composite score bonus to matching categories
   - Generate parlays from archetype profiles (`winning_archetype_3pt_scorer`, `winning_archetype_reb_ast`) alongside other strategies
   - Run Monte Carlo simulations on all candidates

3. **Invalidate cached queries** so the dashboard immediately reflects new parlays

### Technical Details

No code changes needed. This is a one-time invocation of the existing `bot-generate-daily-parlays` edge function via `supabase.functions.invoke()`. The function already contains winning archetype profiles at every tier level:

- **Exploration** (3 profiles each for 3pt_scorer and reb_ast, minHitRate 52-55%)
- **Validation** (2 profiles each, minHitRate 60%)
- **Execution** (2 profiles each, minHitRate 65%)

The new parlays will be appended to `bot_daily_parlays` for today and the `bot_activation_status` row will be updated accordingly.

To trigger this, a simple call will be made from the frontend using the existing `useBotEngine` hook's `generateParlays` mutation, or directly invoking the edge function. Since this is a manual trigger, no file changes are required -- we just need to call the function.

**Implementation**: Add a one-click trigger in the UI (or use the existing "Generate Parlays" button on the Bot Dashboard) to invoke `bot-generate-daily-parlays` with today's date. If the user prefers, we can invoke it directly right now via the edge function invocation tool.
